# Guide Bot
An example of a Discord.js Bot Handler. Updated and Maintained by the Idiot's Guide Community.

Ages ago, Guide Bot was actually a little bot I had on the official discord.js server.
It helped me link to the d.js bot making guide I was building, with links.
This bot grew into something that I could show new coders and bot makers, but
over time it grew into a full framework - one that is now under the hands of a 
group of contributors, and no longer easily "understandable" by the majority
of our newbies. So I've pulled the original Guide Bot out of the mothballs,
gave it a fresh coat of paint and grease, and here it is back in its full glory!

## Requirements

- `git` command line ([Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)|[Linux](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)|[MacOS](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)) installed
- `node` [Version 12.0.0 or higher](https://nodejs.org)
- The node-gyp build tools. This is a pre-requisite for Enmap, but also for a **lot** of other modules. See [The Enmap Guide](https://enmap.evie.codes/install#pre-requisites) for details and requirements for your OS. Just follow what's in the tabbed block only, then come back here!

You also need your bot's token. This is obtained by creating an application in
the [Developer section](https://discord.com/developers) of discord.com. Check the [first section of this page](https://anidiots.guide/getting-started/the-long-version.html) 
for more info.

## Intents

Guidebot uses intents which are required as of October 7, 2020. 
You can enable privileged intents in your bot page 
(the one you got your token from) under `Privileged Gateway Intents`.

By default GuideBot needs the Guilds, Guild Messages and Direct Messages intents to work.
For join messages to work you need Guild Members, which is privileged.
User counts that GuideBot has in places such as in the ready log, and the stats 
command may be incorrect without the Guild Members intent.

Intents are loaded from your config, and will get created by the setup scripts.

For more info about intents checkout the [official Discord.js guide page](https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/intents.html) and the [official Discord docs page](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#gateway-intents).
## Downloading

In a command prompt in your projects folder (wherever that may be) run the following:

`git clone https://github.com/An-Idiots-Guide/guidebot.git`

Once finished: 

- In the folder from where you ran the git command, run `cd guidebot` and then run `npm install`
- **If you get any error about python or msibuild.exe or binding, read the requirements section again!**
- Run `node setup.js` to generate a proper configuration file and settings.

## Starting the bot

To start the bot, in the command prompt, run the following command:
`node index.js`

## Inviting to a guild

To add the bot to your guild, you have to get an oauth link for it. 

You can use this site to help you generate a full OAuth Link, which includes a calculator for the permissions:

# Guide Bot

A boilerplate of a Discord.js Bot Handler.
Updated and Maintained by the [Idiot's Guide Community](https://discord.gg/vXVxsAjSMF).

Guidebot is an attempt to show the basics of command and event handling, in clear, concise,
and commented code. Guidebot can be used as the template for any type of bot, and contains
most of the basic features you would need:

- A command handler
- A basic permission system
- An event handler
- Basic useful commands
- Per-server configuration system
- A logging system

Functionally [guidebot](https://github.com/AnIdiotsGuide/guidebot/) is identical to [guidebot class](https://github.com/AnIdiotsGuide/guidebot/tree/class), but the difference is that guidebot
class is created with classes whilst this version is purely function based.

## Requirements

- `git` command line ([Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) | [Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux) | [MacOS](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)) installed
- `node` [Version 16.x](https://nodejs.org)
- The node-gyp build tools. This is a pre-requisite for Enmap, but also for a **lot** of other modules. See [The Enmap Guide](https://enmap.evie.codes/install#pre-requisites) for details and requirements for your OS. Just follow what's in the tabbed block only, then come back here!

## Intents

You can enable privileged intents in your bot page
(the one you got your token from) under `Privileged Gateway Intents`.

By default GuideBot needs the Guilds, Guild Messages and Direct Messages intents to work.
For join messages to work you need Guild Members, which is privileged.
User counts that GuideBot has in places such as in the ready log, and the stats
command may be incorrect without the Guild Members intent.

Intents are loaded from the index.js file, and the installer is pre-set with the Guilds, Guild Messages and Direct Messages intents.

For more info about intents checkout the [official Discord.js guide page](https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/intents.html) and the [official Discord docs page](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#gateway-intents).

## Downloading

Create a folder within your projects directory and run the following inside it:

`git clone https://github.com/anidiotsguide/guidebot.git .`

Once finished:

- In the folder from where you ran the git command, run `npm install`, which will install the required packages.
- **If you get any error about python or msibuild.exe or binding, read the requirements section again!**
- Rename `config.js.example` to `config.js`, and give it the required intents and any partials you may require.
- Rename `.env-example` to `.env` and put in your bot token in it and save.

## Starting the bot

To start the bot, in the command prompt, run the following command:
`node index.js`

## Inviting to a guild

To add the bot to your guild, you have to get an oauth link for it.
